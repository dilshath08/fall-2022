## Reading (for next week)

* [Built-in data structure, functions, files](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) -- McKinney, Chapter 3
* Along with McKinney, reading from last week.

## Verify requirements

Verify that students have basic requirements (python, conda, git) as specified in 01-Intro.md

* conda with data science tools (anaconda or miniconda) installed
* REPL and an editor/IDE (Note the sad news about atom:-(
* git on the command line

## Iris dataset

* [iris dataset](./iris_dataset.md)

## In-class exercise: penguins

* [penguins.md](./penguins.md)

## In-class exercise -- Colab for prototyping, git & github for submission

* Verify that students can access their github accounts
* Demonstrate how to clone their gh-classroom repo, modify a file and submit an assignment (on Canvas)
* Asking questions via github
* Personal and private repos
* github tutorials
  * hands on to verify that each student has basic capabilities
* [git.md](./git.md) -- migrating from colab to git and github
* [colab.md](./colab.md) -- hints on using colab (from last week)
